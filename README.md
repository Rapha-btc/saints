;; Resurrection

;; Dr. $uss of $aints is aiming to pioneer a first-of-its-kind $aint resurection from Stacks (aka "Evil 3 letters")
;; to Bitcoin ordinals, via a two-way bridge. The proposed process is:

;; 1. The NFT owner on Stacks designates their Bitcoin Wallet (smart contract on STX)
;; 2. They then transfer their NFT tpo 'cant-be-evil.stx' (smart contract lacks a burn function).
;; 3. The Saints web portal then permits the specified Bitcoin address to inscribe the $aint resurected Bitcoin ordinals.

;; A question remains: does Dr. $uss need an oracle/DeepLake for step 3?
;; Answer: Deeplake oracle will be able to check that the nft was burnt

;; The potential hype for this project is significant, given the high-profile community involved.
;; As Trevor says, the quality of a community's members dictates its market cap.

;; Returning from Bitcoin to STX follows this process:

;; To bridge from Bitcoin to STX, it may be prudent to wait until the sBTC protocol enables such conversions.
;; We suggest developing a fresh set of Stacks contracts that would ensure a maximum limit
;; for the entire collection or establish a mechanism to freeze it once it reaches 777.
;; In the event that the IPFS image or video becomes inaccessible in the future, the holder of the NFT
;; on the Stacks (STX) blockchain will retain control over the ordinal on Bitcoin.
