;; Resurrection.clar
;; Dr. $uss of $aints is aiming to pioneer a first-of-its-kind $aint resurection from Stacks (aka "Evil 3 letters")
;; to Bitcoin ordinals, via a two-way bridge.
;; Dr Suss provides 167 minimized ASSETS (777) JPEG and backs up the original IPFS files on a server or IPFS pinning service.
;; The proposed process is:

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; - T1: Lock NFT in Stacks Smart contract (resurrection.clar) + insert map of [token-id and Taproot Address of receiver]
;; - T2: Inscribe ordinal with assets from Creator + lock ordinal in DLC using DeepLake graphql API
;; - T3: Take T2 transaction and feed it in a method from resurrection.clar that verifies the token-id and Taproot Address of receiver from the Bitcoin T2 transaction is the same as from the insert-map (define-map sleepers in resurrection.clar) and then burns the token-id on Stacks (transfers it to cant-be-evil.stx for $aints and uses the burn function of boom-nfts and seven-bitcoin-days for 21 bitcoins days (get-owner become none)
;; - T4: Outcome 1: release ordinal to Taproot receiver address. Outcome 2: 21 days and no T3 has occured, the Ordinal is sent to a wallet controlled by the Human Rights Foundation or another charity.

;; Returning from Bitcoin to STX follows this process:

;; To bridge from Bitcoin to STX, it may be prudent to wait until the sBTC protocol enables such conversions.
;; See Andre's post on sords https://forum.stacks.org/t/sbtc-ordinals-sords/14623
;; We suggest developing a fresh set of Stacks contracts that would ensure a maximum limit
;; for the entire collection or establish a mechanism to freeze it once it reaches 777.
;; In the event that image or video become inaccessible in the future on IPFS, the holder of the NFT
;; on the Stacks (STX) blockchain will retain control over the ordinal on Bitcoin.

;; Closing thoughts
;; "The sleeper must awaken." "The sleeper has awakened!"
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; "When you get to the void, there is an enormous and unbelievable sense of relief, that's nirvana."
;; "So they are liberated and yet they can't quite say why or what it is that they found out, so they call it the void.
;; "But Nagarjuna went on to say, You mustn't cling to the void. You have to void the void. And so the void of non void is the great state of Nagarjuna's Buddhism."
;; "You see, space is your mind. It's very difficult for us to see that because we think we're in space and look out at it. Spaces... They're the dimensions of consciousness."
